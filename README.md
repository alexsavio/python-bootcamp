I've copied and modified the content of their IPython notebooks to give free short courses to computer science students.

In the end of some notebooks I've put references, indicating from where I've gathered ideas for them.

I've done my best to accomplish all licenses from the things I've used. If you think I'm missing a license requirement, please send me an email.
