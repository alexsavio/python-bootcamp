      "Lambda expressions are a shorthand technique for creating single line, anonymous functions. Their simple, inline nature often \u2013 though not always \u2013 leads to more readable and concise code than the alternative of formal function declarations. On the other hand, their terse inline nature, by definition, very much limits what they are capable of doing and their applicability. Being anonymous and inline, the only way to use the same lambda function in multiple locations in your code is to specify it redundantly."

The function is called with the first two elements from the list, then with the result of that call and the third element, and so on, until all of the list elements have been handled. This means that our function is called n-1 times if the list contains n elements. The return value of the last call is the result of the reduce() construct. In the above example, it simply adds the arguments, so we get the sum of all elements. (Note: since Python 2.3 there's a built-in function sum()that does the same thing more efficiently.) "

One point to bear in mind, though, is that a list comprehension executes somewhat faster than a comparable solution using map and lambda (some quick tests yielded a performance difference of roughly 10%). This is because calling a lambda function creates a new stack frame while the expression in the list comprehension is evaluated without doing so."

One would think that list comprehensions have little to recommend themselves over the seemingly more compact map() and filter() notations. However, the picture changes if one looks at a more realistic example. Suppose we want to add 1 to the elements of a list, producing a new list. The list comprehension solution is [x+1 for x in S]. The solution using map() is map(lambda x: x+1, S). The part \u201clambda x: x+1\u201d is Python\u2019s notation for an anonymous function defined in-line."
